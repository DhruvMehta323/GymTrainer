# GymTrainer
It is Pose Estimation Project which is made using mediapipe and opencv. It counts the repetitions of exercises. This code is useful for 4 exercises: Leg Press, Bench Press, Bicep Curls ans Tricep Curls
# Project Setup
- I have used **Mediapipe** to find angle and position of the movements and **OpenCV** to input and output videos. 
- I have made this project considering Right-Hand-Side Camera Angle. We can change that by changing landmark points respectively.


  
**Getting Started**
  + The **Pose.py** contains reusable functions defined in a class. 
  + The **Exercise.py** contains the code that uses those fuctions to give the output to various exercises. It is like main.py file.
  + Add one of the videos' path from the video folder into Exercise.py. You can also use your webCam instead.
